Things to do:
-Separate the larger text file into 4 smaller ones to make parsing easier
-Make the parser able to take in a text file of any length
(cannot have empty spaces in the array, I think this just means we add, instead of initializing it to 40)
-make the corellograms function in analysis.ml (MUHAMMAD)
-update the build script so that we compile all of the files 

-create the matlab script (MUHAMMAD)
-clean up all of the comments in the code. 
-edit the relevant sections of the writeup (MUHAMMAD)
-within the writeup, give conclusions on how effective our methods were (this is BS)
